    <blockquote>
        "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail. 
        The world belongs to those who think and act with it, who keep a finger on its pulse, 
        and become active participants in shaping its direction. This is the essence of 
        self-reliance and the heart of an individual life lived boldly."
